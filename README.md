# Aloha Project 

The Aloha Project is an intro project on the use of HTML/CSS with basic functions of JavaScript and jQuery. Using CSS3 properties as well as the jQuery plugin Flickity, I was able to create a site that creates an interactive user experience. 

The website incorporates Responsive Web Design (RWD) that is designed using a mobile first approach. It is optimized for 3 screen sizes mobile, tablet (min-width 600px), and desktop (min-width 1240px). Although, for now there are still areas to improve on regarding the optimization such as the alignment of some page elements as well as some stylistic features. 

In addition to the RWD, this project also incorporates the use of flickity to enable smooth scrolling as well as the carousel that allows the user to view products using a carousel wheel. There is also a notification on the top of the page after the user submits an email on the form submission area, which is coded using jQuery. 

Working on this project allowed me to apply the skills and techniques that I learned in my first 2 weeks at RED Academy. Although the site does not completely resemble the sample site, this project provides me more opportunities to improve and enhance the site as I continue my journey in RED Academy. By the end of the program I will aim to continually add to this project enhancing the user experience further.
